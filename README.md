# Car-Detection-Using-OpenCV

### Project Description
This project uses OpenCV library and Haar Cascade technique to detect cars in a video.
The program reads a video, detects cars, draws red rectangles around them, and displays the video in a window.

### How to Use
 1. Put all project files in the same folder:
 • Python script (car_detector.py)
 • cars.xml file
 • Video file (car.mp4)
 2. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project folder.
 3. Run the script with this command: python car_detector.py
 4. A window will open showing the video with red rectangles around detected cars.
 5. Press the q key to close the window and stop the program.
